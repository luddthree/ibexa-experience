# Galach query language syntax

## Terms

1. `Word` term is a string not containing whitespace, unless that whitespace is escaped.

    ```
    word
    ```
    ```
    another\ word
    ```

2. `Phrase` term is formed by enclosing words within double quotation marks `"`.

    ```
    "reality exists"
    ```
    ```
    "what's not real doesn't exist"
    ```

3. `User` term is defined by the leading `@` character, followed by at least one alphanumeric or
    underscore character, followed by an arbitrary sequence of alphanumeric characters, hyphens,
    underscores, and dots.

    Regular expression:

    ```
    @[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]*
    ```

    Examples:

    ```
    @joe.watt
    ```
    ```
    @_alice83
    ```
    ```
    @The-Ronald
    ```

4. `Tag` term is defined by the leading `#` character, followed by at least one alphanumeric or
    underscore character, followed by an arbitrary sequence of alphanumeric characters, hyphens,
    underscores, and dots.

    Regular expression:

    ```
    \#[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]*
    ```

    Examples:

    ```
    #php
    ```
    ```
    #PHP-7.1
    ```
    ```
    #query_parser
    ```

## Operators

Terms can be combined or modified using binary and unary operators:

1. `Logical and` is a binary operator that combines left and right operands so that both must
    match.

    It comes in two forms: `AND`, `&&`

    In both cases, it must be separated from its operands by whitespace.

    ```
    coffee AND milk
    ```
    ```
    tea && lemon
    ```

2. `Logical or` is a binary operator that combines left and right operands so that at least one of
    them has to match.

    It comes in two forms: `OR`, `||`

    In both cases, it must be separated from its operands by whitespace.

    ```
    potato OR tomato
    ```
    ```
    true || false
    ```

3. `Logical not` is a unary operator that modifies its operand so that it must not match.

    It comes in two forms: `NOT`, `!`

    When `NOT` form is used, it must be separated from its operand by whitespace:

    ```
    NOT important
    ```

    When shorthand form `!` is used, it must be adjacent to its operand:

    ```
    !important
    ```

4. `Mandatory` is a unary operator that modifies its operand so that it must match.
    It's represented by a plus sign `+` and must be placed adjacent to its operand.

    ```
    +coffee
    ```

5. `Prohibited` is a unary operator that modifies its operand so that it must not match.
    It's represented by a minus sign `-` and must be placed adjacent to its operand.

    ```
    -cake
    ```

### Operator precedence

Unary operators are applied first. Since they apply to the first element to the left, they never
conflict. They are followed by binary operators, with `Logical and` preceding `Logical or`:

1. `Logical not`, `Mandatory`, `Prohibited`
2. `Logical and`
3. `Logical or`

## Grouping

Terms and expressions can be grouped using round brackets. A group is processed as a whole. The
following two examples will be processed as the same since grouping follows operator precedence:

```
one OR NOT two AND three
```
```
one OR ((NOT two) AND three)
```

But you can also use grouping to change the meaning that would follow from operator precedence:

```
(one OR NOT two) AND three
```
```
one OR NOT (two AND three)
```

## Domains

Domain is an abstract category on which the term or group applies. It's defined by prefixing the
term or group with a domain string, followed by a colon `:`. Domain string must start with at least
one alphanumeric or underscore character and is followed by an arbitrary sequence of alphanumeric
characters, hyphens `-`, underscores `_` and dots `.`.

Note that the domain cannot be used on `Tag` and `User` terms. These two, in fact, define implicit
domains of their own.

Regular expression for domain string:

```
[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]*
```

Examples:

```
type:aeroplane
```
```
title:"Language processor"
```
```
description:(wings AND propeller)
```

## Special characters

The characters that are part of the language syntax must be escaped in order not to be recognized as
such by the engine. These are:

- `(` left paren
- `)` right paren
- `+` plus
- `-` minus
- `!` exclamation mark
- `"` double quote
- `#` hash
- `@` at sign
- `:` colon
- `\` backslash
- `‚ê£` blank space

Character used for escaping is backslash `\`:

```
joined\ word
```
```
"escaped \"double quote\""
```
```
escaped \+operator domain\:word \@user \#tag \(and so on\)
```
```
double backslash \\ is a backslash escaped
```

Aside from the quotation marks themselves, escaping is not required inside phrases. Since quotes are
used as delimiters, everything between them is taken as-is. Hence these will be interpreted as equal
in meaning:

```
"+one -two"
```
```
"\+one \-two"
```

In some cases the tokenizer will automatically assume that a special character is to be interpreted
as if it was escaped. The following pairs will be processed as the same:

1. Colon at the end of a `Word` is considered part of the `Word`

   ```
   word:
   ```
   ```
   word\:
   ```

2. Colon placed after a domain colon is considered part of the `Word`

   ```
   domain:domain:domain
   ```
   ```
   domain:domain\:domain
   ```

3. Domain can't be used on a `Tag` and `User` terms

   ```
   domain:#tag domain:@user
   ```
   ```
   domain:\#tag domain:\@user
   ```

4. Characters used for `Mandatory`, `Prohibited` and shorthand `Logical not` operators can be
   considered part of the `Word`:

   - When placed after domain colon

      ```
      domain:+word domain:-word domain:!word
      ```
      ```
      domain:\+word domain:\-word domain:\!word
      ```

   - When placed in the middle of the word

      ```
      one+two one-two one!two
      ```
      ```
      one\+two one\-two one\!two
      ```

   - When placed at the end of the `Word`

      ```
      one+ two- three!
      ```
      ```
      one\+ two\- three\!
      ```
